# Supporting Companies

The USACO Guide is run by the
[Competitive Programming Initiative](https://joincpi.org/), a registered
501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. We depend heavily on the support of many
different companies to provide our services for free, and are immensely grateful
to the following companies for generously providing discounted or free services:

- [Microsoft for Nonprofits](https://microsoft.com/)
- [Algolia](https://algolia.com/), free search functionality
- [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) for providing the visual testing
  platform that helps us review UI changes and catch visual regressions
- [Google for Nonprofits](https://google.com/) and the
  [G Suite](https://workspace.google.com/) Nonprofit Plan
